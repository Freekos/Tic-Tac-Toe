~Tic-Tac-Toe: game written in pure JavaScript

## what functions are there??
* You can choose which side to play.
* You can see the stats.
* You can restart the game.
* You are playing against the computer.

## Rules:
* You won't be able to start playing until you choose which side to play.

## What else??
* The computer playing against you makes random moves, since I did this for fun, I decided not to complicate the task and made random moves, so if you want, you can modify the moves
